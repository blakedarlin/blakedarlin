# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Blake.

I currently work as a full-stack developer at Media Proper, building custom WordPress sites, plugins, and Gutenberg blocks for businesses and organizations. Have a look at our [portfolio](https://www.mediaproper.com/work)!

## About Me
I lead a small team that turns out products consistently on time, that meet or exceed expectations, and are very performant. It's something I have a passion for and to which my temperament is well-suited. I enjoy building tools that enable us to maximize the impact of our labor while reducing the risk and impact of errors. I enjoy exploring technical strategies for productivity, including low-code, automation, AI, and well-chosen components. I enjoy thoughtful and elegant design, which is the most critical and rewarding strategy.

## Tech Stack
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=wordpress,vite,react,nodejs,docker,gulp,webpack,yarn,python,prometheus,flask,nginx,redis,gitlab,github,figma,js,jquery,php,html,svg,bootstrap,tailwindcss,css,sass,linux)](https://skillicons.dev)

## 2024 Interests
- React-based Gutenberg block development
- Node.js transform streams (for more performant Gulp plugins)
- Building with Vite and React
- Tailwind CSS
- CI/CD pipelines üöÄ
- Block development: fetching (AJAX), caching (Redux stores), and display of external API data
- Block development: adding icons to the native Button block

## Fun facts
- ‚ö°Ô∏è I have a research degree in auto/biography and a (I would say) healthy obsession with the life and times of Benjamin Franklin, Colonial America & Georgian England, and national mythology.
- I studied, worked, and lived in the UK off and on for 7 years and loved it.
- When I was just out of high school I learned Flash working at a media agency in Brussels, Belgium.

## üì´ Get in touch
I'm [open to discussing](mailto:hello@blakedarlin.com) a website project with you. (Depending on the complexity, scope, and type of your site I might refer you to an agency I know does good work.)
