# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Blake.

I build custom WordPress sites, plugins, and Gutenberg blocks for businesses and organizations.

## About Me
I have experience leading teams in turning out products consistently on time, which meet or exceed expectations and are very performant. It's something I have a passion for and to which my temperament is well-suited. I enjoy building tools that enable us to maximize the impact of our labor while reducing the risk and impact of errors. I enjoy exploring technical strategies for productivity, including low-code, automation, AI, and well-chosen components. I enjoy thoughtful and elegant design, which is the most critical and rewarding strategy.
